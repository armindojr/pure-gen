This project is derivative (Fork) from [Faker.js](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js) and that's why most of that code is here. This fork is created to update some features inside original repo and extends its functionality.

### API Documentation
- [Docs](https://armindojr.github.io/pure-gen/)

## CLI
Now you can use pure from cli after installing. 

Run in your cli:
```
$ npx pure repl
```

This will start repl interface with pure. For more information see [Repl](https://armindojr.github.io/pure-gen/repl.html)

or:
```
$ npx pure generate
```

This will ask some questions and generate fake data based on pre-configured template. You can save in any given format. For more information see [Generator](https://armindojr.github.io/pure-gen/generator.html)


## Usage

First, install package with:
```
$ npm i --save pure-gen
```

```js
const pure = require('pure-gen');

let randomName = pure.name.findName(); // Rowan Nikolaus
```

## Localization

pure-gen has support for multiple localities.

The default language locale is set to English.

[How to set specific location](https://armindojr.github.io/pure-gen/pure.html#.setLocale)

## Setting a randomness seed

If you want consistent results, you can set your own seed:

```js
pure.seed(123);

let firstRandom = pure.random.number();

// Setting the seed again resets the sequence.
pure.seed(123);

let secondRandom = pure.random.number();

console.log(firstRandom === secondRandom);
```

_Note_: Setting the seed to `0` (`pure.seed(0)`) is the same as not having a seed. The seed must be greater than zero.

If you want to known your current seed then you can:

```js
console.log(pure.getSeed())
```

## FAQ

What purpose serve this repository?
- This project purpose is to update old code from faker.js and extend it with new functionalities

Why have you decided to fork?
- Just because i wanted to bring some quick features without the gap time that exists if i have done an PR to original project

Why did you renamed it?
- Because i wanted to publish this as an new package in npm

What are the major changes compared to original project?
- I removed all script builds that make this generator compatible with standalone js. In my opinion older node versions is hard to mantain too, so i decided to only offer support to versions after v10. All unit tests is rewrite to use modern testing tools like chai and sinon with mocha. Extended changelog in CHANGELOG.md
